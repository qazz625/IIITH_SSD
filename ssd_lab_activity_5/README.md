### Working
- Open the index.html page.
- Clicking on Login button redirects you to studentRecords.html page
- Initially there is no data so only the table headings are displayed
- Add New button adds a new element to the row by taking input from the two input fields(the inputs can be empty)
- The input gets cleared after a new entry is added
- Delete row button deletes the last row from the table
- If there are no rows and only the table heading, the delete button will not do anything
